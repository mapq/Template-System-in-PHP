# Simple Template System in PHP

The tiny template is a very simple template language implemented in PHP to be used for small projects and classroom instruction.  The language supports conditionals, repetitions, and calls to functions embedded in HTML. I wrote it to explain how template systems work and to demonstrate why they need to have some amount of computation in them.

Since its first version, I have added a few things that were easy to add but extended it beyond the original goals. There are still a few things left to be implemented.
